				So it's just another evening when I'm browsing <a href="news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a> and stumble across <a href="https://xuanwo.io/links/2025/01/link-blog/">this article on "link-blogging"</a> by Xuanwo. Xuanwo got the idea from an article (https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/) by Simon Willison. Simon even responded to his post on hacker news, and made another post metntioning Xuanwo post for some ultimate recursion - the world is small.

				Simon describes link-blogging as a category falling under "things I've found", alongside "things I've learned" and "descriptions of projects". I pretty much fell in love with the idea immediately. I have a desire to write more on the latter two but sometimes it feels insurmountable to start writing about these things. link-blogging on the other hand feels much more achieveable and hopefully would be a good gateway to start doing the other two more.
			</p>
			<p class="text-primary-300">
				I don't participate in social media much, but I frequently come across cool articles or blogs that I either want to praise or have a bone to pick. This could be the perfect outlet for that. Even if I don't have anything meaningful to say on the topic, it's important that I beging writing more.

			<p class="text-primary-300">
				So thank you Xuanwo and Simon for inspiring this whole thing, let's see how long it lasts.
